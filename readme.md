# FACE DETECTION AND RECOGNITION


Technology has advanced a lot in the remaining few decades. Previously there have been no safety cameras, 
there have been solely safety guards who guard these areas. Once the protection cameras got here into existence, 
it grew to be convenient to locate humans passing inside the vary of CCTV cameras by way of absolutely looking out via the movies recorded. 
The face is one of the best methods to distinguish the man or woman identification of every other. 
Face awareness is a private identification device that makes use of the non-public traits of a individual to pick out the person's identity.

Below are the three steps for the face recognition which are as follows:

**Data Gathering:** Gather numerous face pictures of the people you need to perceive.

**Training of Face Recognizer:** Store the information of face and the names of particular individual to the face recognizer.

**Face Recognition:** Check on the new human countenances whether the prepared model remembers them.

OpenCV as of now has a face recognizer module, just our undertaking is to take care of it with the exact face information.
In general, in this task, we will figure out on the issue of face discovery and acknowledgment of a person. Our undertaking will be 
fit for distinguishing the human whose information we have gathered as of now. We will utilize Image Processing with the assistance of OpenCV, 
utilizing Python language.
